#What is PPL?
PPL is an acronym for the weight training schedule that focuses on splitting the workouts into 3 body groups: upper body pulling muscles, upper body pushing muscles and legs. Each group is then trained separately on its own workout day. 

- Push Day - Chest, Shoulders and Triceps
- Pull Day - Back and Biceps
- Leg Day - Quads, Hamstrings and Calves

The schedule can be run a couple of different ways, but this app will be ran in the original format: The fixed 6-Day classic schedule (Sunday Off).

**6 Day Classic Schedule (Sunday Off)**
- Monday: Push
- Tuesday: Pull
- Wednesday: Legs
- Thursday: Push
- Friday: Pull
- Saturday: Legs
- Sunday: Rest

#What routine will be used for this application?
For the application, I'll be using a routine that's fairly popular on [r/Fitness](http://reddit.com/r/fitness), [A Linear Progression Based PPL Program for Beginners by Metallicapd] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/).

After getting permission from the creator of this routine, I've decided to go ahead and turn this routine into an app to help promote the routine and provide beginners with an alternative to the usual "build your strength base by doing a strength training program first" advice.
