#What is PPL?
PPL is an acronym for the weight training schedule that focuses on splitting the workouts into 3 body groups: upper body pulling muscles, upper body pushing muscles and legs. Each group is then trained separately on its own workout day. 

- Push Day - Chest, Shoulders and Triceps
- Pull Day - Back and Biceps
- Leg Day - Quads, Hamstrings and Calves

The schedule can be run a couple of different ways, but this app will be ran in the original format: The fixed 6-Day classic schedule (Sunday Off).

**6 Day Classic Schedule (Sunday Off)**
- Monday: Push
- Tuesday: Pull
- Wednesday: Legs
- Thursday: Push
- Friday: Pull
- Saturday: Legs
- Sunday: Rest

#What routine will be used for this application?
For the application, I'll be using a routine that's fairly popular on [r/Fitness](http://reddit.com/r/fitness), [A Linear Progression Based PPL Program for Beginners by Metallicapd] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/).

After getting permission from the creator of this routine, I've decided to go ahead and turn this routine into an app to help promote the routine and provide beginners with an alternative to the usual "build your strength base by doing a strength training program first" advice.

#Core Functionality of the PPL Application
When it comes to working out, aside from consistency and keeping track of your diet (that's a whole different app idea), keeping track of what you've done in the gym is key. Some people like to keep it old school by bringing a notebook and pen to the gym, some have complicated apps that have all this extra fluff that isn't conducive to your workout, and some even use the notes app and a timer (ew!). The PPL App will aim to do the absolutely to track your workouts and do them well.

- **Simple Workout Logging Interface & Functionality** - The most important part of this app, or any workout app, should be logging your workouts. When I'm in the gym the last thing I want to do is fumble through screens trying to log my workout. It's key to make this process as simple as possible. Influenced by StrongLifts, as soon as you select the number of reps for your set the rest countdown will start and then go off when it's time for another set.

- **Changing Weight Is Nice & Easy!** - Changing the weight on an exercise is simple and intuitive. You don't even need to do any mental math as it tells you how much weight belongs on each side. (Okay, maybe you need to do a bit of mental math, but plate calculator coming soon!)
